## üß© Overview
This project is my implementation of the **SAP-1 (Simple As Possible) CPU** using **Logisim Evolution**.  
It demonstrates the core principles of computer architecture ‚Äî fetching, decoding, and executing 8-bit instructions through modular hardware blocks.

The design follows the Von Neumann architecture and includes ALU, registers, memory, control logic, and a program counter.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features
- 8-bit data bus, 4-bit address bus  
- Program Counter, Instruction Register, and Control Sequencer  
- Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) supporting ADD and SUB operations  
- RAM and Register File integrated with control signals  
- Step-by-step and auto clock execution modes  
- Fully modular design with labeled subcircuits  
- All components built manually in Logisim (no pre-made components)

## üß† Architecture
![Main Circuit](Images/main.png)

The SAP-1 consists of the following major modules:
- **Program Counter (PC)** ‚Äî holds the address of the next instruction  
- **Memory Address Register (MAR)** ‚Äî stores current memory address  
- **RAM (SRAM)** ‚Äî stores program instructions and data  
- **Instruction Register (IR)** ‚Äî holds opcode and operand  
- **Registers (A & B)** ‚Äî for temporary data storage  
- **ALU** ‚Äî performs addition and subtraction  
- **Control Section** ‚Äî orchestrates the fetch-decode-execute cycle

## üïπÔ∏è Control Unit
![Control Unit](Images/decoder.png)

The control unit is a **hardwired sequencer**.  
It generates timing and control signals (T1‚ÄìT6) to activate micro-operations for each instruction.  
A counter and decoder combination ensure instruction flow and clock synchronization.

## üßæ Instruction Set

| Mnemonic | Opcode (Hex) | Description |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| LDA | 1D | Load value into Register A |
| LDB | 2E | Load value into Register B |
| ADD | 30 | Add B to A |
| SUB | 40 | Subtract B from A |
| STA | 5F | Store A into memory |
| JMP | 65 | Jump to given address |
| HLT | F0 | Halt program execution |

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run
1. Open the `.circ` file (`2008007_cs_project.circ`) in **Logisim Evolution**  
2. Load your hex program into ROM:
3. Turn ON the clock and observe each micro-step  
4. Check Register A, B, and output register for results  
5. Use the **Auto Load** feature for continuous execution

## üöÄ Future Work
- Add instructions: `OUT`, `JZ`, and `NOP`  
- Implement microprogrammed control logic  
- Extend to **SAP-2** with branching and flag registers  
- Display unit (7-segment) integration
