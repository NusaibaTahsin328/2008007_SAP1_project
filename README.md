## üß© Overview
This project is an implementation of the **SAP-1 (Simple As Possible) CPU** using **Logisim Evolution**.  
It demonstrates the core principles of computer architecture, including fetching, decoding, and executing 8-bit instructions through modular hardware blocks.  
The design is based on the Von Neumann architecture and contains an ALU, registers, memory, control logic, and a program counter.

## üß† Architecture
The SAP-1 consists of these major modules:

- **Program Counter (PC)** ‚Äî holds the address of the next instruction to be executed.  
  It increments automatically after each instruction unless a jump occurs.  
  ![Program Counter](https://github.com/NusaibaTahsin328/2008007_SAP1_project/blob/main/pc.png)

- **Memory Address Register (MAR)** ‚Äî temporarily stores the memory address from which the CPU wants to read or write data.  
  It acts as the bridge between the CPU and RAM.  

- **SRAM** ‚Äî stores both program instructions and data values.  
  This is the main memory of the SAP-1 where instructions and operands reside.  
  ![SRAM](https://github.com/NusaibaTahsin328/2008007_SAP1_project/blob/main/sram.png)

- **Instruction Register (IR)** ‚Äî holds the currently fetched instruction (both opcode and operand).  
  This allows the control unit to decode and execute the instruction step by step.  
  ![Instruction Register](https://github.com/NusaibaTahsin328/2008007_SAP1_project/blob/main/ins%20reg.png)

- **Registers (A & B)** ‚Äî temporary storage for arithmetic operations.  
  Register A is usually the accumulator, while B is used as a secondary operand.  
  ![Registers](https://github.com/NusaibaTahsin328/2008007_SAP1_project/blob/main/reg.png)

- **ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)** ‚Äî performs arithmetic operations like ADD and SUB.  
  It takes inputs from registers A and B and outputs the result back to A or the output register.  
  ![ALU](https://github.com/NusaibaTahsin328/2008007_SAP1_project/blob/main/ALU.png)

- **Control Sequencer** ‚Äî a hardwired unit that orchestrates the fetch-decode-execute cycle.  
  It generates control signals for all other components in a precise timing sequence.

## üïπÔ∏è Control Unit
The control unit uses a **hardwired sequencer** that generates timing and control signals (T1‚ÄìT6) for each micro-operation.  
A state counter and decoder combination ensures correct instruction flow and clock synchronization.

## üßæ Instruction Set

| Mnemonic | Opcode (Hex) | Description |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| LDA | 1A | Load value from memory address into Register A |
| ADD | 2B | Add value from memory address to A |
| SUB | 3C | Subtract value from memory address from A |
| STA | 4D | Store value of A into memory address |
| JMP | 50 | Jump to given address |
| OUT | 70 | Output value of Register A |
| NOP | 00 | No operation / unused |
| HLT | F0 | Halt program execution |

<a id="How to run"></a>
## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run
1. Open the `.circ` file (`2008007_cs_project.circ`) in **Logisim Evolution**  

2. Load your **ROM program and RAM data together** as one script:

```text
# ROM (0‚Äì7)
0: 1A  ; LDA 10
1: 2B  ; ADD 11
2: 3C  ; SUB 12
3: 4D  ; STA 13
4: 50  ; JMP 0
5: 70  ; OUT
6: 00  ; NOP / unused
7: 00  ; NOP / unused

# RAM (10‚Äì15)
10: 0A
11: 0B
12: 0C
13: 0D
14: 00
15: 00
## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run
1. Turn ON the clock and observe each micro-step  
2. Check Register A, B, and output register for results  
3. Use the **Auto Load** feature for continuous execution
